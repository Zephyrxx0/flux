# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-13)

**Core value:** Operations teams can monitor and respond to real-time crowd risks during a live match, receiving AI-generated safety alerts tied to actual game events, while fans get real-time navigation assistance through a stadium chatbot.
**Current focus:** Phase 17 — weather-integration

## Current Position

Phase: 17 (weather-integration) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 3
Status: Executing Phase 17
Last activity: 2026-07-15 — Phase 17 execution started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Phase 14 Plans

| Plan | Wave | Tasks | Files | Dependency |
|------|------|-------|-------|-----------|
| 14-01 Data mapping | 1 | 3 | 4 | - |
| 14-03 useMatchPoller | 1 | 2 | 2 | - |
| 14-02 API proxy | 2 | 2 | 2 | 14-01 |
| 14-04 Dashboard | 2 | 3 | 5 | 14-01, 14-03 |

## Phase 14 Key Decisions (from discuss-phase)

- D-14-01: Server-side proxy for worldcup26.ir — Next.js API route, not client-side fetch
- D-14-02: JWT token in WORLDCUP26_TOKEN env var, server-only, never in client bundle
- D-14-03: Match state schema updated with nullable minute for phase flexibility
- D-14-06: 30s polling interval with 3x exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s)
- D-14-09: Page Visibility API pauses polling when tab hidden
- D-14-11: Route group `(dashboard)/` for layout isolation
- D-14-16: Sim slice lazy initialization with presets.normal
- D-14-18: User must register on worldcup26.ir and set WORLDCUP26_TOKEN env var

# Phase 15 Plan 02: Client-side alert infrastructure Summary

Implemented the client-side infrastructure to consume, store, and display real-time AI alerts via SSE.

## Accomplishments

- Added FIFO 50 cap to `alertSlice` to prevent unbounded memory growth
- Built `useAlertStream` hook to connect to `/api/alert`, parse SSE, dispatch to store, and handle exponential backoff reconnection
- Created `AlertFeed` component to render severity-coded alerts with auto-scroll and a "New alerts below" chip

## Deviations from Plan

- In `tests/hooks/useAlertStream.test.ts`, had to use `function() { return mockEventSource; }` instead of an arrow function so the mock could be instantiated with `new EventSource`.
- In `tests/components/dashboard/AlertFeed.test.tsx`, mocked `IntersectionObserver` using a class to allow `new IntersectionObserver()` in the component.

## Self-Check: PASSED

## Accomplishments

- Created zone data server spike to ensure deterministic simulation works without client deps
- Built `src/lib/ai/gemini.ts` for streaming Gemini responses and Zod validation
- Implemented `src/app/api/alert/prompts.ts` to build structured AI prompts
- Replaced stub in `src/app/api/alert/route.ts` with a fully functional SSE route handler

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Self-Check: PASSED

## Performance

- **Duration:** 15 min
- **Started:** 2026-07-14T15:50:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-07-14T16:05:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments

- Created `MatchBanner` component in `src/components/dashboard` representing four separate match states (live, loading, upcoming, and error).
- Wrote and verified full rendering test suite in `tests/components/dashboard/MatchBanner.test.tsx` for MatchBanner edge cases.
- Implemented `/dashboard` page and route layout group. Hooked up `useMatchPoller` to `DashboardPage` and bound it to update `liveStore` via `setMatch`.
- Implemented `initializeSim` on dashboard load (INT-02).
- Expanded vitest's scope to run on `.tsx` tests.
- Wrote unit tests confirming `simSlice.initializeSim` and `simSlice.reset` correctly configure state.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create MatchBanner component + tests** - `2d9740a` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create dashboard layout + page** - `2d9740a` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Create simSlice initialization test** - `2d9740a` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** (will be committed next)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/dashboard/MatchBanner.tsx`
- `tests/components/dashboard/MatchBanner.test.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `tests/stores/simSlice.test.ts`
- `vitest.config.ts`

## Decisions Made

- Updated vitest configuration `include` pattern from `"tests/**/*.test.ts"` to `["tests/**/*.test.ts", "tests/**/*.test.tsx"]` to accommodate new React component test files.
- `MatchBanner` consumes its props natively, bypassing hook nesting while remaining clean.
- `useMatchPoller` inside `/dashboard` routes straight to `/api/match` and updates `liveStore`.

## Deviations from Plan

- Passed `cleanup()` manually in vitest for component tests to ensure `afterEach` clears the `.animate-pulse` components globally between iterations.

## Issues Encountered

- Missing TSX tests initially in `vitest.config.ts`. Fixed.
- Testing Library overlapping elements because of missing automated cleanup. Fixed.

## User Setup Required

None

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 14 is complete. The application now supports polling worldcup26.ir, storing that data in `matchSlice`, and rendering it into a Live Ops dashboard via the Next.js router. The Phase is now ready for `complete-phase` audit and transition to Phase 15.

## Performance

- **Duration:** 10 min
- **Started:** 2026-07-14T15:35:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-07-14T15:45:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Implemented `useMatchPoller` custom hook to handle interval polling at 30s.
- Handled API failures with 3 retry attempts using exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s).
- Maintained previously fetched data when the maximum retries were reached (displaying a temporary error state instead).
- Added `document.hidden` (Page Visibility API) to pause polling in inactive tabs and immediately fetch when refocused.
- Achieved full test coverage with 9 unit test cases mapping out the lifecycle using vitest's fake timers.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create test file for useMatchPoller** - `66847a6` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create useMatchPoller hook** - `66847a6` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** (will be committed next)

## Files Created/Modified

- `tests/hooks/useMatchPoller.test.ts` - Comprehensive timing test cases.
- `src/hooks/useMatchPoller.ts` - Polling logic and `PollerState` definitions.

## Decisions Made

None - followed plan as specified

## Deviations from Plan

None

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None

## Next Phase Readiness

`useMatchPoller` hook is ready to be consumed by the Dashboard layout for the final `14-04` plan.

## Performance

- **Duration:** 10 min
- **Started:** 2026-07-14T15:06:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-07-14T15:15:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Implemented `/api/match` route handler as a secure proxy to `worldcup26.ir`.
- Added strict error handling returning 500 for missing configuration and 502 for upstream/parse failures.
- Prevented `WORLDCUP26_TOKEN` exposure by using server-side `process.env`.
- Written 6 vitest integration tests using `vi.stubEnv` and mocked global `fetch`.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create test file for /api/match route** - `0822837` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Implement /api/match route handler** - `0822837` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** (will be committed next)

## Files Created/Modified

- `tests/api/match.test.ts` - Integration tests covering all 6 success/error scenarios.
- `src/app/api/match/route.ts` - Next.js proxy route handler implementation.

## Decisions Made

- Removed `import "server-only"` as the package wasn't installed, relying on Next.js `route.ts` server boundaries instead.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Optional missing package] Removed `import "server-only"`**

- **Found during:** Task 2 verification (`vitest`)
- **Issue:** The `server-only` package is not installed in the workspace, causing vitest to fail module resolution.
- **Fix:** Removed the `import "server-only"` line from `route.ts`. 
- **Files modified:** `src/app/api/match/route.ts`
- **Verification:** Vitest and tsc completed successfully after removal.
- **Committed in:** `0822837` (part of task 2 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (optional missing package)
**Impact on plan:** None. The route handler inherently executes on the server in Next.js App Router, so the security boundary is still maintained.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

**External services require manual configuration.** See `14-USER-SETUP.md` (if applicable) for:

- Environment variables to add: `WORLDCUP26_TOKEN`

## Next Phase Readiness

API proxy is completed. Ready for frontend polling implementation via `useMatchPoller` hook (Plan 14-03).

## Performance

- **Duration:** 15 min
- **Started:** 2026-07-14T14:50:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-07-14T15:05:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments

- Updated MatchStateSchema minute field to be nullable (null for pre-match, half-time, full-time).
- Changed matchSlice store to use the imported MatchState type instead of an inline type.
- Created robust Zod schemas (WorldCup26GameSchema) reflecting the actual worldcup26.ir JSON shape.
- Built parseTimeElapsed and mapGameToMatchState functions to normalize the messy API output into our domain model.
- Wrote full unit test coverage (12 cases) passing for the mapping edge cases.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update MatchStateSchema with nullable minute** - `ee81f36` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Update matchSlice.ts with typed MatchState import** - `2409ee5` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Create worldcup26.ts API utility + unit tests** - `ac1d2df` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** (will be committed next)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/types/match.ts` - Made minute field nullable for MatchState.
- `src/stores/slices/matchSlice.ts` - Switched to canonical MatchState import.
- `src/lib/api/worldcup26.ts` - Schemas and utilities for worldcup26 API.
- `tests/lib/api/worldcup26.test.ts` - Unit tests.

## Decisions Made

None - followed plan as specified

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Scope boundary] Pre-existing test failure in store.test.ts**

- **Found during:** Task 2 (Update matchSlice.ts)
- **Issue:** The existing `tests/ui/store.test.ts` test suite failed due to `localStorage` being undefined (environment issue). 
- **Fix:** Did not attempt to auto-fix the test environment as it is outside the scope of this task. Tracked as deviation.
- **Files modified:** None
- **Verification:** The test failure is isolated to `useScenarioStore` and `localStorage`, entirely unrelated to `matchSlice`.

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (scope boundary/ignored)
**Impact on plan:** None. The types and slice updates are correct.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

Data mapping is complete. Ready for API proxy and `useMatchPoller` implementation (Plans 02 and 03).
