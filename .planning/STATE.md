# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-13)

**Core value:** Operations teams can monitor and respond to real-time crowd risks during a live match, receiving AI-generated safety alerts tied to actual game events, while fans get real-time navigation assistance through a stadium chatbot.
**Current focus:** Phase 13 — foundation-architecture-decision

## Current Position

Phase: 13 (foundation-architecture-decision) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-07-13 — Phase 13 execution started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 21 (v1.0)
- Average duration: 5 min
- Total execution time: 0.4 hours

**By Phase (v1.0):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 2 | 10 min | 5 min |
| 2 | 3 | 35 min | 12 min |
| 3 | 3 | - | - |
| 4 | 3 | - | - |
| 5 | 3 | - | - |
| 6 | 5 | - | - |
| 7 | 1 | - | - |
| 8 | 1 | - | - |

*v2.0 metrics will populate as phases execute.*
| Phase 13 P01 | 2 min | 2 tasks | 5 files |
| Phase 13 P02 | 2 min | 2 tasks | 6 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 13 pending]: Express vs Next.js — must audit actual `src/app/` and `next.config.mjs` to determine migration cost
- [Phase 13 pending]: Zustand store splitting strategy — single store with slices vs. separate sub-stores
- [Phase 13 pending]: Claude model ID selection — verify current model at implementation time
- [Research]: SSE on Cloud Run requires `proxy_buffering off` and `proxy_read_timeout 600s` in nginx config

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Express vs Next.js decision:** Must be resolved in Phase 13 before any code is written. Research identifies this as a hard fork with significant downstream impact.
- **SSE streaming on Cloud Run:** Risk of silent failure due to proxy buffering/timeouts. Must test against deployed URL, not just localhost.
- **Claude API cost:** Unbounded alert cycles could exceed budget. Must implement cycle caps and AbortController.
- **API key security:** Anthropic and OpenWeatherMap keys must never leak to browser. Server-only proxy required.
