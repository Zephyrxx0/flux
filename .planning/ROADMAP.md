## Phase Details

### Phase 13: Foundation & Architecture Decision

**Goal**: Resolve Express vs Next.js architecture decision, define store splitting strategy, create shared type definitions, scaffold server runtime path
**Depends on**: Nothing (first v2.0 phase)
**Requirements**: None (foundation decision — no user-facing requirement)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Architecture decision (Express vs Next.js) documented in PROJECT.md Key Decisions with rationale
  2. Shared TypeScript type definitions exist in per-domain `src/types/*.ts` files with Zod schemas and barrel export
  3. Zustand store splitting strategy defined with sub-store slices (sim/match/weather/alert/chat) composed via createStore + StateCreator
  4. Server runtime scaffolded with API route handler skeleton and updated Dockerfile

**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:

- [x] 13-01-PLAN.md — Type definitions (Zod schemas) + build config (standalone, Docker, scripts)
- [x] 13-02-PLAN.md — Zustand store architecture (5 slices + combined store)
- [ ] 13-03-PLAN.md — API route skeletons + PROJECT.md decision documentation

### Phase 14: Server Runtime + Match Polling

**Goal**: Server runtime running in production mode, match polling delivering live data to simulation store, match banner visible on ops dashboard
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: LIVE-01, LIVE-03, INT-02, DEP-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Ops dashboard displays live match score, phase, and minute in a MatchBanner component
  2. Match data from worldcup26.ir is fetched every 30s via `/api/match` proxy and updates simulation state
  3. Simulation store (`simulationStore`) initializes with existing zone data from v1 engine
  4. Application serves from the new server runtime (Express or Next.js) with environment variables configured

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 15: AI Alert Stream

**Goal**: Claude analyzes zone density data every 45s and streams ops alerts via SSE, displayed in a severity-coded live feed on the dashboard
**Depends on**: Phase 14 (requires match data + populated simulation store)
**Requirements**: AIAL-01, AIAL-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Ops dashboard displays live AI alerts categorized by severity (nominal, warning, critical) in an AlertFeed component
  2. Alert feed updates automatically as new alerts arrive via SSE, with auto-scroll to latest
  3. Alerts are visually distinct by severity level (color, icon, urgency treatment)
  4. AbortController cancels alert generation on component unmount or page navigation

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 16: Fan Chatbot

**Goal**: Fan-facing `/fan` route with chatbot that answers stadium navigation questions grounded in live zone context and match state
**Depends on**: Phase 14 (requires simulation store with zone data and match state)
**Requirements**: FAN-01, FAN-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Fan can navigate to `/fan` route and see a chatbot interface with message input
  2. Fan can ask stadium navigation questions and receive contextually grounded answers that reflect live zone density and match state
  3. Chatbot responses stream in as they're generated (SSE) with buffered rendering
  4. Conversation history is maintained within session (capped at 10 messages)
  5. Quick question chips are available for one-tap demo queries

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 17: Weather Integration

**Goal**: Weather data from OpenWeatherMap adjusts zone densities (rain/heat/stadium effects) and weather card is displayed on ops dashboard
**Depends on**: Phase 14 (requires server runtime + simulation store)
**Requirements**: WTHR-01, WTHR-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Ops dashboard shows a WeatherCard with current weather conditions (temperature, conditions, icon)
  2. Zone densities adjust based on weather factors (rain accelerates egress, heat reduces capacity) as an overlay on planned density
  3. Weather data refreshes automatically at appropriate intervals (10min) without manual reload

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 18: Demo Mode + Integration Wiring

**Goal**: Complete integration of all live hooks into ops dashboard, demo mode with canned match events, phase transition density deltas, and deployment finalization
**Depends on**: Phase 15, Phase 16, Phase 17 (all live features must exist before integration)
**Requirements**: LIVE-02, DEMO-01, INT-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Canned match event sequence plays back in demo mode when no live match is playing, covering full match lifecycle (kickoff, goal, halftime, second half, full-time)
  2. Match phase transitions (goal, half-time, full-time) trigger calibrated zone density deltas visible in the simulation
  3. All live hooks (useMatchPoller, useAlertStream, useWeather) fully wired into ops dashboard components
  4. Demo/live toggle works with complete state reset and visual "DEMO MODE" indicator
  5. All components accessible through MagneticDock navigation tabs

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes
