# Predictive Fan Flow Simulator → Smart Stadium Operations

## What This Is

A live GenAI-powered stadium operations system for FIFA World Cup 2026 — ingesting real match events, simulating crowd dynamics in real time, streaming AI safety alerts to ops teams, and simultaneously answering fan queries, all from a single simulation engine. Built on the existing pre-event crowd simulation engine, now coupled with live data feeds (match events, weather) and dual-mode AI (operations alerts + fan assistant).

## Core Value

Operations teams can monitor and respond to real-time crowd risks during a live match, receiving AI-generated safety alerts tied to actual game events, while fans get real-time navigation assistance through a stadium chatbot.

## Current Milestone: v2.0 Smart Stadium Operations

**Goal:** Upgrade from pre-event planning tool to live GenAI-powered stadium operations system — real match event coupling, AI alert streaming, fan-facing mode, weather integration.

**Target features:**
- Live match feed → simulation coupling (worldcup26.ir API)
- AI alert stream (Claude in the simulation loop, SSE)
- Fan-facing mode (/fan route, stadium chatbot)
- Weather layer (OpenWeatherMap integration)
- Demo-proof simulation (canned match sequence)
- Ops dashboard components (MatchBanner, AlertFeed, WeatherCard)

### Active

<!-- Current scope for v2.0. Building toward these. -->

- [ ] **LIVE-01**: Simulation responds to live match events from worldcup26.ir via 30s polling
- [ ] **LIVE-02**: Match phase transitions (goal, half-time, full-time) trigger zone density deltas
- [ ] **LIVE-03**: Ops dashboard displays live match score, phase, and minute banner
- [ ] **AIAL-01**: Claude analyzes zone density data every 45s and streams ops alerts via SSE
- [ ] **AIAL-02**: Alerts are classified by severity (nominal, warning, critical) and displayed in live feed
- [ ] **FAN-01**: Fan-facing /fan route with chatbot answering stadium navigation questions
- [ ] **FAN-02**: Fan chatbot receives live zone context and match state for grounded answers
- [ ] **WTHR-01**: Weather data from OpenWeatherMap adjusts zone densities (rain/heat/stadium)
- [ ] **WTHR-02**: Ops dashboard shows current weather conditions with density impact notes
- [ ] **DEMO-01**: Canned match event sequence for demo when no live match is playing
- [ ] **INT-01**: useMatchPoller, useAlertStream, and useWeather hooks wired into ops dashboard
- [ ] **INT-02**: Simulation store initialized with existing zone data from the v1 engine
- [ ] **DEP-04**: Environment variables (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OWM_API_KEY) configured on deployment

### Out of Scope

- Real-time live sensor ingestion during events — this project focuses on pre-event simulation, not operational telemetry.
- Native mobile apps — web-first scope for hackathon timeline and delivery speed.
- Multi-tenant enterprise admin features — unnecessary for v1 judging criteria.
- 3D stadium model (Three.js/Cesium) — 3-5 days for visual payoff that doesn't address GenAI requirement.
- Transit/traffic APIs (TomTom, GTFS) — Brittle, rate-limited, hard to demo.

## Context

### v1.0 (Shipped)
The original Predictive Fan Flow Simulator shipped as a pre-event planning tool with:
- 12 phases covering deterministic simulation, scenario configuration, D3 visualization, Gemini AI risk reporting, comparison workflow, Cloud Run deployment, and UI overhaul
- 21 validated requirements — all checked complete
- Deployed to Google Cloud Run as a static Nginx build

### v2.0 (Current)
The upgrade from pre-event planning to live operations adds:
1. **Live match feed** — Poll worldcup26.ir every 30s, detect phase transitions (goal, half-time, etc.), apply zone density deltas
2. **AI alert stream** — Claude analyzes zone data every 45s, streams SSE alerts to ops dashboard
3. **Fan mode** — Separate /fan route with chatbot using live zone context
4. **Weather layer** — OpenWeatherMap integration adjusts densities for rain/heat/storm

Architecture principle: simulation state (`simulationStore`) is the single source of truth. Both ops AI and fan chatbot read from the same store.

- Transitioned from Vite+Nginx to Next.js standalone (D-01, D-03)
- Server runtime via Next.js API route handlers (D-08)
- Store architecture via Zustand store with slices (D-05)
- Type system via Zod schemas per domain (D-11, D-12)

## Constraints

- **Timeline**: About 13 days — hackathon window requires strict MVP-first sequencing.
- **Platform**: Google Cloud Run deployment — final demo must be publicly reachable as `*.run.app`.
- **Tooling**: Google Antigravity required — implementation should preserve prompt-driven build workflow.
- **Architecture**: No traditional backend service — simulation runs client-side, app served as static assets.
- **AI Integration**: Gemini key handling via build-time injection — avoid committing secrets and keep deployment repeatable.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Use React + Vite + Tailwind + D3 | Fast build velocity plus expressive, custom visualization for simulation output | ✓ Good |
| Keep simulation client-side in `StadiumSim` | Removes backend complexity and speeds Cloud Run deployment | ✓ Good |
| Trigger one Gemini call per simulation run | Controls cost and keeps report generation deterministic | ✓ Good |
| Prioritize scenario presets (Normal, Sold Out, Gate Crisis) | Strengthens demo narrative and judge-facing clarity | ✓ Good |
| Deploy as static app on Cloud Run with Nginx | Meets platform requirement with minimal operational overhead | ✓ Good |
| Use Zustand for simulation store | Central state that both ops AI and fan chatbot read from | — Pending |
| Claude for both ops alerts and fan chat | Same model, different system prompts, same sim state | — Pending |
| SSE for AI streaming | Simpler than WebSockets, server-to-client streaming is the right fit | — Pending |
| Server-side proxy for third-party APIs | Never call worldcup26.ir or OWM from client | — Pending |
| Migrate fully to Next.js, drop Vite | Next.js already in deps, provides API routes natively, single process (no Express) | ✓ Decided per D-01 |
| Hybrid migration path — v1 pages as client components, v2 routes as App Router | Zero-cost coexistence; existing React Router code works as client components in shared layout | ✓ Decided per D-02 |
| Deploy as Next.js standalone output on Cloud Run | output:'standalone' produces a Node server; no nginx needed | ✓ Decided per D-03 |
| Remove nginx from deployment | Next.js standalone server listens directly on PORT; nginx adds proxy complexity | ✓ Decided per D-04 |
| Single Zustand store with slices (sim/match/weather/alert/chat) | Slice pattern enables cross-slice coordination without circular dependencies | ✓ Decided per D-05 |
| Lazy init simSlice on first dashboard access | Zone data loaded when ops dashboard mounts, not at app root | ✓ Decided per D-06 |
| Ephemeral in-memory for all v2 slices | No localStorage; avoids stale alert/chat data across page loads | ✓ Decided per D-07 |
| One Next.js API route per service (/api/match, /api/weather, /api/alert, /api/chat) | File-based routing keeps each endpoint isolated and independently testable | ✓ Decided per D-08 |
| SSE via native Response + ReadableStream | No Express or SSE library needed; Cloud Run standalone has no nginx to interfere | ✓ Decided per D-09 |
| Docker: single-stage node:22-alpine with output:standalone | Clean minimal image; server.js entry point respects PORT/HOSTNAME env vars | ✓ Decided per D-10 |
| Zod schemas for all new types (not plain TS interfaces) | Runtime validation at API boundaries; replicates existing src/simulation/contracts/ pattern | ✓ Decided per D-11 |
| Per-domain type files (src/types/*.ts) with barrel export | Avoids monolithic live.ts; clear domain boundaries via separate modules | ✓ Decided per D-12 |
